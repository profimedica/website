### Security Overview

Here is how applications vulnerabilities are mapped to existent regulations:

| ***Insecure Interfaces and APIs*** | This is not a threat, is a vulnerability. |
| ***Malicious Insiders*** | Not a threat, a vulnerability. Is not mapped. |
| ***Shared Technology issues*** | ISO 27000-27002 and PCI-DSS compliance. |
| ***Data Loss and Leakage*** | ISO 17862 and HIPPA compliance. |
| ***Account or Service Hijacking*** | There is no clear mapping in current regulations. |

### Security challenges

Medical apps are expected to provide secured services to their customers. If the apps are exploited the data is at risk. A vulnerability on one of the apps can damage the entire exchange system. For this reason, the security at the information exchange level is not sufficient.
Periodic penetration tests have to be performed to keep the participant apps and the entire system at low risk.
Another concern is data storage. The data can be exchanged only beteen participants that the user has agreed with. Non-sensitive and statistical data is easier to exchange.

### Existent standards

We will only include few examples.

The ***human medicine domain*** is strongly regulated and it's security standards are well defined by regulatory acts like HIPAA

Health Insurance ***Portability and Accountability*** Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Rules and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act.

71% of tested medical apps have at least one high level security vulnerability. According to <a targe="_blank" href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2020/09/30/covid-19-tracking-apps-leak-data/">helpnetsecurity.com</a>

The lack of reference architectures and relevant patterns makes compliance harder than it should be. According to Eduardo B. Fern√°ndez on <a targe="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/302066474_A_survey_of_compliance_issues_in_cloud_computing">researchgate.net</a>
