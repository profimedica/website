## Veterinary Medicine Information Exchange
Non-Profit Organization for providing standards on vmie.org

Developer volunteers

If you can code, and you like to contribute to our MIT-licensed non-profit open-source projects you can register as vmie contributor.

At vmie.org we embrace a KISS approach on technology.

Backend: .Net8

Frontend: Vue 2 without a build step.

Styling: Keep it minimal. Reuse when possible. Avoid inline style-ing.

Markdown: The main content of all pages if markdown. Easy to edit.

## Get involved

You can join our vision either as developer, pet owner, vet or scientist.

## Our mission

We are developing the standards and a POC framework for a new approach in Veterinary Medicine Information Exchange (vmie).

The desi is driven by people preferences on privacy.

Below are few concepts we are set to develop.

# Projects

## ePetId

**What ePetId is not**

- is <span>not a replacement of the official identification</span> that is required by your jurisdiction, like a microchip. Please see the UK regulations: Get your dog or cat microchipped

- is not a proof of property/ownership.

- is not enforced or regulated

**What is ePetId**

- a generated on-demand number to be used in data exchange applications that align with vmie open standards in Veterinary Medicine Information Exchange

- is not bounded to a jurisdiction and therefore can be used anywhere

- is free and easy to manage

## Data safety considerations

Your pet's privacy has to be stronger than your own.

Here's why: 

- you or any of your family members can use pets info on bank <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2008/01/why-are-bank-security-questions-so-monstrously-stupid.html">security questions</a>, or other security checks.

- someone close to you can become a victim of <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/identity-theft">identity theft</a> and impersonation.

- your pet name is <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=d47403ad-b291-47e3-ba0b-f7bb846a2958">personal information</a> under GDPR.

### How it works?
A pet owner requests a **ePetId** from vmie. The **ePetId** is provided as text and as QR. No requirements at this step.

Anyone can scan a QR to visit the corresponding pet profile.

By default, no information is publicly available on a pet profile. It is the owner that can define what information is visible by who, including the anonymised information.

Pet owners can receive requests to share some information, but never their personal details.

From GDPR point of view, with enough effort the data can be traced back to the user, so the user has to understand the risks.

### Privacy Profiles
Like many other agreements in life, humans are not always checking the full content of agreements and even if they do, they might be not aware at the time of the consequences.

That's why, for complex scenarios like the management of privacy, standards are evolving to provide safe choices for people.

With the help of community, we are developing and standardize privacy profiles for pets.

This will make the management of privacy easier to navigate and as safe as the community requires.

### Privacy risks mitigation
The user will only add non-sensitive information about the pet, never as free text, always as selection from a valid range of options.
When numeric values are required, the valid values will not make a continuous domain. Valid values will be discrete over their domain. This is to ensure that users, for their own security, are limited in the values they can insert.
